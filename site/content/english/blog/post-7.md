With the [voting](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox/issues/38#issuecomment-1862551641) only just closed, it is a phenomenal moment for the K8sGPT project to be voted into the CNCF.
As the first Artificial Intelligence and Kubernetes tool that has been accepted, there is a responsibility but equally an incredible opportunity to pave the way for others.

We will work together with the CNCF communities and challenge ourselves to identify the role AI has yet to play. Bridging between groups of practitioners, vendors and end-users to exemplify the potential that AI has yet to bring within Cloud Native.
