A brilliant new tutorial from Ana誰s shows everyone how to get started.

In this tutorial, Ana誰s shows us how to get started with K8sGPT. She walks us through the installation process and how to use the tool. She also shows us how to use the `--explain` command to get more information about the output of the analyzers.
